# Zero-E Bootstrap Repository

This repository exists **only to support legacy versions** of Zero-E after the project was moved to my new GitHub account.

Older installations of Zero-E automatically check this repository for updates.  
Instead of the original script, they now receive a **small, signed bootstrap updater** that:

1. Verifies the identity of the official new repository.
2. Downloads and installs the current Zero-E release from its new home.
3. Continues running normally.

> âœ… This is expected behavior â€” it ensures older installations stay up to date without manual intervention.

The new official repository is:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/sl3yE/zero-e](https://github.com/sl3yE/zero-e)

If you discovered this repo manually and are concerned about authenticity, you can verify the bootstrap script:
- Check that it references the correct new repo ID and URL.
- Compare the file contents to the latest commit in the new repository.
- Optionally, verify the commit signature if used.

This repo contains **no functional code other than the bootstrap script**.
